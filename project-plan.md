## Project Plan 

#### Functional and nonfunctional requirements that remain to be met for the final product
- UI Implementation across the entire site
- Consistency fixes across the website
- Clearing out bugs in our issue tracker -- ‘backlog grooming’
- Create a business/release strategy plan
- Shift the emphasis from uploading from local to pulling content from Facebook

#### Other work to be done to deliver the final product
- User tests 
- Personas and scenarios development
- Create and organize a feature list
- Create a business/release strategy plan

#### Most important work to do to make progress on delivering the final product
- Our final product should have a polished, consistent UI across all of the web pages. Our product should also behave as we expect: no links or actions should lead to error pages, and the back-end and front-end should be smoothly integrated. Our sponsor explained that our aim is to do a small set of things, but to do them very, very well.

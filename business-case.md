### What we are building  

We are building a standalone web application that will gather information from a person’s digital life (Facebook, initially, then other social media and digital presences in the future) and allow users to create a memorial in remembrance of the deceased. The application will process and present the information collected about the deceased in the form of a private online pages. Users will be able to edit the memorial and add their own stories as a way to remember their loved one, as well as have the option to finalize it into a more permanent state.

### Why we are building it

We are building this application for our sponsor, Jed Brubaker, whose research work explores the issues surrounding a person’s digital life after they have passed, especially the accessibility and stewardship over their information on social media. Currently, social media websites like Facebook lack sensitive management of a deceased user’s account. Epilogue seeks to be an application that users can use to help memorialize their deceased loved one’s digital information that otherwise may be lost or inaccessible. Our application will act as a tool for Jed and other researchers to gather information from the family and friends of the deceased to explore the question of online data stewardship as they curate pieces from their loved one’s digital life.

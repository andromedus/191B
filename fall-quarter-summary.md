#### Where is our project now?



#### What are the main pending tasks we have now?

Our presentation slide deck needs MAJOR fine-tuning. For the March Showcase, we shouldnâ€™t keep presenting our project in terms of what we did per quarter, but in terms of the overall project with more focus on the application and the technologies behind it. We need a more compelling presentation.

The elevator pitch is getting better, but we should keep improving it and add to it our findings after deploying the app to be able to answer some of the questions that our pitch talks presents.

A big question that Jed would possibly want us to come up with a solution for is how to convey the point of the app being a private space, and how to help users understand the notion of collaborators within the app. That may require a redesign of the collaborator function in the app. It may also require reevaluating the app to perhaps come up with a better design solution than what we currently have.

Jed would like for the Stories feature in the app to be one of the main focuses on each memorial. That will require a redesign of the front-page memorial. 

Diary studies is going to happen at the start of Winter quarter. Information on this is forthcoming and Jed will have news of it for us when Winter quarter starts. He would like us to participate in it because he wants to involve the developers so that we would know exactly how to fix all the technical problems or requests that come up when the app is deployed. 

#### What should we do to complete those tasks?

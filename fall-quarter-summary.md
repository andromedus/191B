## Fall Quarter Summary


#### Where is our project now?

  The functionality is complete. Our app looks much better than it did at the beginning of the quarter with all the current user interface improvements, but the UI is still not good enough for deployment as the big issue here is how to design sensitively with the user’s experience in mind. Their experience leans more on the delicate side as death is a sensitive subject, so every UI detail in making a clean, nice, and respectable memorial page counts. Jed has already conducted 8 interviews with what we have so far, and we have some feedback from those interviews for which we can take action, but Jed does not want us to use that feedback as a buglist. He would like us to address some items, however, such as how we can let users know that the app is meant as a private space, and how we can fix the app to convey the notion of collaborators in a clearer way. During Winter quarter, he would like to have several groups of users use our application for diary studies and we will be participating in that. 


#### What are the main pending tasks we have now?

  Our presentation slide deck needs MAJOR fine-tuning. For the March Showcase, we shouldn’t keep presenting our project in terms of what we did per quarter, but in terms of the overall project with more focus on the application and the technologies behind it. We need a more compelling presentation.

  The elevator pitch is getting better, but we should keep improving it and add to it our findings after deploying the app to be able to answer some of the questions that our pitch talks presents.

  A big question that Jed would possibly want us to come up with a solution for is how to convey the point of the app being a private space, and how to help users understand the notion of collaborators within the app. That may require a redesign of the collaborator function in the app. It may also require reevaluating the app to perhaps come up with a better design solution than what we currently have.

  Jed would like for the Stories feature in the app to be one of the main focuses on each memorial. That will require a redesign of the front-page memorial. 

  Diary studies is going to happen at the start of Winter quarter. Information on this is forthcoming and Jed will have news of it for us when Winter quarter starts. He would like us to participate in it because he wants to involve the developers so that we would know exactly how to fix all the technical problems or requests that come up when the app is deployed. 
  
We also need to be able to pull even more Facebook data than we currently do for use cases where someone would want to dig as far back into a loved one’s digital life as a few decades. 

There are parts of the app that need to be reevaluated- such as signing in to the app and making sure there are no discrepancies there when a user a logs in and how that is displayed in the navigation bar. Others are listed below.

#### What should we do to complete those tasks?

For some issues, we should add messages to the user into our system, to explain when things are taking too long or when we do not want them to take an action, such as creating a duplicate memorial. 

We should fix the death date issue- someone should not be able to post-date a memorial. 

We should sit down and come up with a few mockups for how to put Stories front and center as a feature of the app. 

We should come up with a solution for conveying the notion of collaborators and that the app is a private space. 

We should prepare for the diary studies and make sure every piece of the app is approved by Jed before deployment, that will include making the necessary changes at the interaction and implementation level.

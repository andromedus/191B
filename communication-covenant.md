# Team communication and co-working agreement

Team Andromedus

Alexis Hoshino, Eric Tian, HQ Pham-Nguyen, Kathleen Enverga

## Meetings

Weekly with Sponsor: Wednesdays, 2-3 PM, LUCI Lab

Weekly with Team: Wednesdays, 3-4 PM, LUCI Lab or wherever we choose for the day.

Any other meetings that our team feels like we need will be scheduled with input from everyone.

## File management

We will use Git and GitHub for code management.

We will use Google Docs for document drafting and management.

Specifically, we will keep files in GitHub repositories owned by our sponsor, "Epilogue."

We will keep documentation in the "docs" repository of Andromedus.

We will be using Andromedus’ repository on GitHub for issue tracking.

## Miscellaneous

Organizing and solidifying coworking hours and meeting times helped assure the team’s participation in the project. Co-location during confirmed working hours allowed us to help each other and be up-to-date with any server issues that may have affected our own code. This fall quarter will be different in terms of implementing more agile methods including stand-up meetings and weekly backlog grooming. Backlog grooming consists of cleaning up the issue tracker to ensure that our list is up to date with what we need to do.

In terms of what’s carrying over from spring quarter: we will continue to meet with our sponsor, Jed, to keep him fully informed of our weekly progress and obstacles as well as receive feedback.

## Methods of Communication

Text messages for quick questions, more casual things.

Email will be used for our main communication purposes.

Urgent notifications are sent out by both text and e-mail, to account for the communication convenience of all group members.

We agree to help each other to the best of our abilities.

We agree to respect and understand each other’s opinions, concerns and responsibilities.
